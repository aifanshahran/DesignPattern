Design and implement a Java application of Template Method Design Pattern to check the validity of a given credit card.
For simplicity, you only need to consider three types of credit cards â€” Visa, MasterCard and Diners Club. The application carries out a series of validations on the credit card information. The table below lists different steps in the process of validating different credit cards. As can be seen from the table, some steps of the validation algorithm are the same across all three of the credit cards while some are different. To make sure that the account is in good standing, a check with the credit card company (Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club) is required. This step requires custom programming to interface with the credit card company database and is considered to be different for different credit card types.
