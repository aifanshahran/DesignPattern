One of the implementers of the Logger interface, the FileLogger class, logs incoming messages to the file log.txt. There is only one physical log file. In an application, when different client objects try to log messages to the file, there could potentially be multiple instances of the FileLogger class in use by each of the client objects. This could lead to different issues due to the concurrent access to the same file by different objects.

What is needed is a way to ensure that there exists one and only one instance of the FileLogger class during the lifetime of an application. This needs to be done in such a way that the client objects do not have to monitor the creation process or keep track of the number of FileLogger instances that exist. Accomplish the above by using the Singleton pattern and make FileLogger class a singleton class.
