Consider a user interface toolkit that supports multiple look-and-feel standards, such as Motif and Presentation Manager (PM). Different look-and-feels define different appearances and behaviors for user interface "widgets" like scroll bars, windows, and buttons. To be portable across look-and-feel standards, an application should not hard- code its widgets for a particular look and feel. Instantiating look-and-feel specific classes of widgets throughout the application makes it hard to change the look and feel later.
