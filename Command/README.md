Design and implement a Java program for Command Design Pattern of the following description of a Library Item Management system.
A library item management system is an application to manage items in a library item database. Typical library items include books, CDs, videos and DVDs. These items are grouped into categories and a given item can belong to one or more categories. For example, a new movie video may belong to both the Video category and the NewReleases category.
An Item class represents a typical library item and a Category class represents a category of items. A Category object maintains a list of its current member items. Similarly, an Item object maintains the list of all categories which it is part of. (Hints: You can use a HashMap to store the current member items for a Category object, and also a HashMap to store the current categories of an Item object.)
For simplicity, the library item management system deals only with adding and deleting items. Applying the Command pattern, the action to be taken to process add item and delete item requests can be designed as implementers of a common CommandInterface interface. The CommandInterface provides an abstraction for the processing to be carried out in response to a typical library item management request such as add or delete item. The CommandInterface implementers, namely, AddCommand and DeleteCommand represent the add and the delete item request, respectively.

The ItemManager class acts as an invoker for the application. It invokes operations on the receiver objects (Item and Category). It
- Contains a Command object within
- Invokes the Command objectâ€™s execute method as part of its process method implementation
- Provides a setCommand method to allow client objects to configure it with a Command object

The CommandTest client class uses the invoker ItemManager to get its add item and delete item requests processed. To keep the application simple, no database access logic is implemented. Both Item and Category objects are implemented to simply display a message.

Add a move functionality that allows an item to be moved from one category to another. Implement the move functionality as a combination of delete followed by an add operation. Both delete and add operations must be executed together as a unit to provide the move functionality.
