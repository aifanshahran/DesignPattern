Design and implement a Java program of Facade Design Pattern.

Let us build an application that:
- Accepts customer details (account, address and credit card details)
- Validates the input data
- Saves the input data to appropriate data files

The three classes â€” Account, Address and CreditCard are available in the system, each with its own methods for validating and saving the respective data. These 3 classes work together, as part of a subsystem, providing the features of an online customer.
